In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you will need to include the following information:

- The date of the entry
- A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
- A reflection on any design conversations that you had
- At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

* App name and logos

We came up with our app name and designed some logos as options for our website.

* Docker and sql files
 
I live shared on VSCode and we all completed our Dockerfiles, requirements.txt, and sql files to be able to create a table in our database. We had some guidance from Shawn and Jeff to get our sql file running. 

Today, I learned that I need to remove our database volume and recreate it when changing our database and to use single quotes instead of double quotes in our sql file.
