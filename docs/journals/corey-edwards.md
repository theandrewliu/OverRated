In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you will need to include the following information:

- The date of the entry
- A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
- A reflection on any design conversations that you had
- At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

* App name and logos

We came up with our app name and designed some logos as options for our website 

* Docker and sql files

I was around to watch Shawn and Jeff masterfully help us get out dockerfiles up and running, during the creation of our table for the database as a group we decided we wanted some of our option for things such as gender, sexual orientation, religion, pronouns, and ethnicity we wanted to have dropdown functionality so i did the research cross referencing with other dating apps to fin what the best options are and have them logged for when we need to implement, and also as a team we were able to figure out an app name get some logos flying around undecided on final but we have some good options, and finished our requirements.txt

* SQL files

I was the official creator of the Profile Model inside of our API. We also refactored the database by splitting them into separate SQL files. Also we began the process of setting the profile endpoint in the API but this came with many issues so after tinkering for what felt like an eternity. This was eventually solved with the implementation of Optional from typing thankfully. We didn't get to finish setting the endpoint but we are left with good footing for tomorrow.

* Nav Bar

So today was a very productive day and very stressful spent a lot of time refactoring and frankensteining the nav bar using css and bootstrap but i got it to where the logo takes you back to the home page, the nav bar color is color matched with the logo and the my profile is all the way on the right so good progress has been made i still need to fix the back end routes and clean up some things but we are on the right track
