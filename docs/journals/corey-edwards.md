In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you will need to include the following information:

- The date of the entry
- A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
- A reflection on any design conversations that you had
- At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

* App name and logos

We came up with our app name and designed some logos as options for our website 

* Docker and sql files

I was around to watch Shawn and Jeff masterfully help us get out dockerfiles up and running, during the creation of our table for the database as a group we decided we wanted some of our option for things such as gender, sexual orientation, religion, pronouns, and ethnicity we wanted to have dropdown functionality so i did the research cross referencing with other dating apps to fin what the best options are and have them logged for when we need to implement, and also as a team we were able to figure out an app name get some logos flying around undecided on final but we have some good options, and finished our requirements.txt
