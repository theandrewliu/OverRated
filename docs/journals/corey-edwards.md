In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you will need to include the following information:

- The date of the entry
- A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
- A reflection on any design conversations that you had
- At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

* App name and logos

We came up with our app name and designed some logos as options for our website 

* Docker and sql files

I was around to watch Shawn and Jeff masterfully help us get out dockerfiles up and running, during the creation of our table for the database as a group we decided we wanted some of our option for things such as gender, sexual orientation, religion, pronouns, and ethnicity we wanted to have dropdown functionality so i did the research cross referencing with other dating apps to fin what the best options are and have them logged for when we need to implement, and also as a team we were able to figure out an app name get some logos flying around undecided on final but we have some good options, and finished our requirements.txt

* SQL files

I was the official creator of the Profile Model inside of our API. We also refactored the database by splitting them into separate SQL files. Also we began the process of setting the profile endpoint in the API but this came with many issues so after tinkering for what felt like an eternity. This was eventually solved with the implementation of Optional from typing thankfully. We didn't get to finish setting the endpoint but we are left with good footing for tomorrow.

* Nav Bar

So today was a very productive day and very stressful spent a lot of time refactoring and frankensteining the nav bar using css and bootstrap but i got it to where the logo takes you back to the home page, the nav bar color is color matched with the logo and the my profile is all the way on the right so good progress has been made i still need to fix the back end routes and clean up some things but we are on the right track

* Back End processes

Today a large chunk of our day was spent regarding the processes and working in excalidraw and brainstorming ways that our matching process would work with the concepts of gender and sexuality and working out how we can do that and the creation of a new table and joining them with the profiles and connecting them with that they are vs what they are interested in seemed like the prevailing choice so we were able to do that together for our back end team to begin work on

* React

There wasnt much time left at the end of the day but i cleaned up some unneccesary files and changed some names around but we are working on getting it ready for when we can finally build individual pages

I spent time troubleshooting and planning back end functionality with the team

## June 6, 2022
Today we did our meeting with curtis and he showed us what he was able to help us do with the project which i know the entire team is incredibly grateful for i was able to move some functionality around to help better match our tables also cleaned up the login page and troubleshooted it when thing inevitably went wrong 


## June 7, 2022
Quite the busy day if i do say so myself So we did a bit of troubleshooting all day because it wouldnt be code if i didnt have to put out fires every ten seconds. Thanks to curtis we were able to get the data push for a specific profile onto the my profile by creating a new api route through the back end.with the i was able to css it into submission which truly is a huge load off of my shoulders cause now that means the template is also done for the explore page which is a great two birds for one stone.

## June 8, 2022
Alright so im gonna go over this one very briefly so i implemented the profile settings, account settings, and the like button. The functionality on the like button took much longer than expected so ill have to do the dislike tomorrow but at least for the explore page the buttons are nice and circular and color coordinated. 

## June 9, 2022

Okay so today was kinda hectic one we were out to work i immediately got to work on the dislike button and my achilles heel was that i didnt bind the button at the top of the page but once i did it was smooth sailing. Also i was able to fix it so when a user uploaded a photo it actually used their photo on their profile... most of the time haha. Ill have to go back through and make sure it works for everyone but its a good start. The the last thing i did today was i figured out the way i have to import data into my connections page so i can show a list of matches so tomorrow morning ill be able to hit the ground running with getting our connections page taken care of.
