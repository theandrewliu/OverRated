In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you will need to include the following information:

- The date of the entry
- A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
- A reflection on any design conversations that you had
- At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

Today, we created our sql server to get ready for fastAPI endpoints.

Today I added react capabilities in preparation to be able to create the front-end portion of the app, we refactored the database to be more organized by splitting them into separate sql files. Also got the list all profile endpoint to post 200 but had to edit out the page functionality for it to work. Will revisit that tomorrow to try and implement it.

Got the rest of the Profile API's to work. Had to comment out the validation response for the PUT because it was throwing errors despite the edits going through.
