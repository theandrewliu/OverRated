In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you will need to include the following information:

- The date of the entry
- A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
- A reflection on any design conversations that you had
- At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small
